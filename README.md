In this project, you will implement from scratch, without any library, a web page. I use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledges that I learned previously.

This webpage has been designed by Nicolas Philippot, UI/UX designer.
## Requirements
you are not allowed to import external CSS framework (like Bootstrap)
you are not to use Javascript

## Goals/Objectives
This project consists in Implementing a design from scratch, using my previously knowledges in HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design.

## How can you use this template
You can download this repo and launch in your browser and using [DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/ "DevTools") you can explore the css style sheet and html details to add in your projects.

Here the designs that I have to build from zero:

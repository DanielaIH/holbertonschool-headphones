# holbertonschool-headphones
In this project, you will implement from scratch, without any library, a web page. I use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledges that I learned previously.

This webpage has been designed by Nicolas Philippot, UI/UX designer.
## Requirements
you are not allowed to import external CSS framework (like Bootstrap)
you are not to use Javascript

### This project consists in Implementing a design from scratch

Here the designs that I have to build from zero:
